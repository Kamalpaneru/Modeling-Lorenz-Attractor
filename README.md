# Modeling-Lorenz-Attractor

The Lorenz system is a system of ordinary differential equations first studied by Edward Lorenz. It is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. In particular, the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system which, when plotted, resemble a butterfly or figure eight.

## Modeled With Processing

 Using P3D and PeasyCam (Processing library) the set of Lorentz functions were modeled.<br>
 (PeasyCam provides a dead-simple mouse-driven camera for Processing.)
# Steps to run the program
  1.Download Processing from Processing.org <br>
 2.On top nav bar of processing goto Sketch -> Add library and install PeasyCam .<br>
 3.Run the program
